This is inscribed by Zhang Boyu (fl. late 13th c.) and painted by Zijiu (i.e., Huang Gongwang, 1269-1354). Looking at another scroll by Tianshu (Lan Ying), unrolled just a few inches, [I] feel as though Dachi (Huang Gongwang) has rolled out [of the grave] and been reborn as an apparition.

The Monastery of Clouds and Rocks, with its beautiful natural environment, became the cultural and religious center for literati gathering and generating inspirations for poetry.
